This application is intended to be deployed on Apache Tomcat after being converted to a `.war` file after being imported as an Eclipse EE project.

In addition to this, the machine that this runs on must have port `3306` open for SQL connnections, and a mySQL user with username `mytestuser` and password `mypassword`.
